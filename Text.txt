Oh, ##########! I can't believe I forgot to buy ########## groceries again.
This ########## day just keeps getting worse.
I hope my boss doesn't notice that I'm running late.
I spilled ########## coffee all over my new shirt, and now it looks like I've been through a ########## hurricane. ##########!
